Purpose: 
A portfolio website I have made to showcase my abilities and things about me I would love the world to know.

AutoBiography:
This project is so tedious LOL. 

Required Packages:
npm install react
npm install react-icons


Update:
So I have done a manual deploy on this website when it was originally made before. No errors. However, I have started
working on this project again and I wanted to do a github deploy because that would help me constantly update
this website without worrying about having to manually deploy it everytime. Howvever, the issue with that was
that netlify (the website im using to deploy) is that it treats warnings as errors, so I had to repeatedly fix 
the warnings one by one.
